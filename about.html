          <label class="article-container" for="text">
            When the war ended, the Goldstone Ground was restored and normal
            football began again in 1919. However, 1919/20 was the last season
            of the Southern League in its prime form, and the First Division
            clubs were taken on by the Football League to form a Third Division
            (South) in 1920. It took Albion 38 years to win the section and
            secure the one promotion berth available. Much of the interest
            between the wars was therefore reserved for the FA Cup. The club
            became renowned giant-killers, defeating First Division sides Oldham
            Athletic, Sheffield United, Everton and Chelsea in front of large
            crowds at the Goldstone Ground; and winning away at Grimsby Town,
            Portsmouth and Leicester City. A 1933 cup game against West Ham
            United brought 32,310 spectators to the Goldstone, a record that
            lasted 25 years.

            Albion kept playing throughout the Second World War and never failed
            to fulfil a fixture, but it was a struggle to survive. The directors
            of the nearby greyhound track took control of the club in 1940 to
            stave off financial ruin, while the German Luftwaffe did its best to
            disrupt proceedings. Three games at the Goldstone Ground were
            abandoned because of air-raid warnings, and the North Stand was
            bombed in August 1942 (but no one was hurt). Under the wartime
            regulations, Charlie Webb, who was manager from 1919 until 1947,
            called upon players of other clubs serving with the Army in the
            area, and even had to draft soldiers from the crowd on occasion to
            complete an eleven. The resumption of normal football after the war
            saw attendances escalate to unprecedented numbers. In 1947/48,
            Albion finished bottom of the Football League for the only time and
            had to be voted back into the competition by their fellow members,
            but the average gate was over 11,000, a record. The following season
            it rose to more than 17,000.

            While league form fell apart under Melia, Albion made it to the FA
            Cup final in 1983. Beating Newcastle United and Manchester City,
            Albion then won 2-1 away at Liverpool – one of their greatest
            performances ever – thanks to goals from Gerry Ryan and Jimmy Case,
            to reach the last eight for the first time. Case then scored the
            only goal to defeat Norwich City and set up a semi-final against
            Sheffield Wednesday at Arsenal’s old stadium at Highbury.

            Now Case hit a thunderbolt from 35 yards, and Michael Robinson
            netted from close range to give Albion a 2-1 win and earn a final
            against Manchester United at Wembley. On 21 May 1983, Albion hoped
            to become the first relegated side to win the cup in the same
            season. Despite taking the lead through Gordon Smith, they went 2-1
            down in the second half. With only a few minutes remaining, Gary
            Stevens equalised to force extra time. In the 120th minute there was
            a great opportunity for Albion to score the winner. “And Smith must
            score,” declared the radio commentator, but the shot was saved and
            the game ended immediately thereafter at two goals apiece. The teams
            returned to Wembley for a replay five days later. This time United
            won easily, by four goals to nil. Nevertheless, the 30,000 Albion
            supporters present, so proud of their team, sang their hearts out
            for their heroes.

            The 1998/99 season was better, but the priority was to get the club
            back to Brighton if it was to survive. A fans’ campaign to “Bring
            Home the Albion” supported an application to use Withdean Stadium –
            primarily an athletics track – as a temporary home pending the
            construction of a new stadium in the Brighton area. The campaign
            succeeded despite some local opposition, and Albion moved into
            Withdean in 1999, thrashing Mansfield Town 6-0 in the first league
            game there.
            <iframe

              style="border: none"
            ></iframe>
            Withdean had severe limitations. There was only one small roof to
            keep spectators dry, so most fans sat in temporary stands beyond the
            running track, exposed to the elements. The initial capacity was
            just 6,000, but additional seating was provided over the years and
            the highest gate recorded was 8,729 when Manchester City were beaten
            in the League Cup in September 2008. It was never a “proper”
            football ground, but Withdean kept the club alive for twelve years –
            just as Gillingham had for two years – and it proved to be a pretty
            successful venue for the Albion. In 2001 (the club’s centenary year)
            they were Third Division (now League 2) champions, claiming their
            first title for 36 years, and followed it by winning the Second
            Division (now League 1) the following year. Key to the success was
            the form of Bobby Zamora, a young striker who hit 63 goals in those
            two seasons. Relegation followed straight away as Albion struggled
            against clubs with much greater budgets. But they bounced straight
            back to the Championship via the play-offs, beating Bristol City 1-0
            at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in 2004. And this time they
            survived at the higher level on the last day of the 2004/05 season
            before being relegated again in 2006.

            While Withdean provided breathing space, all efforts were
            concentrated on a site on the edge of Brighton at Falmer that the
            club – and the local council – identified as the best for a new
            stadium, given its ready access to public transport and its
            partly-developed nature. Masterminded by chief executive Martin
            Perry, the plans would give the club a bright future, but first
            permission had to be secured from the city council and then, because
            of the sensitive nature of the site, from the Government. Once
            again, the club’s supporters undertook a lengthy campaign to back
            the plans and win over the politicians. In May 1999 they secured a
            68% vote in favour at a local referendum, and followed it with a
            61,000-signature petition and some intense lobbying.
            <img

              alt=""
            />
            The opposition was also determined though, and a public inquiry
            lasting many months was held, but the results were inconclusive.
            However, a second inquiry concluded that Falmer was the only viable
            location for a stadium in the area, and the Government decided that
            the development was in the public interest because of its social and
            economic benefits for the more deprived areas of Brighton. A flaw in
            the process delayed the final permission until 2007 – ten years
            after the site was first identified. Now came the task of funding
            the construction. Tony Bloom, a long-term supporter of the club,
            stepped up to take over from Dick Knight and provide around £100
            million for the new stadium; and then another £30 million or so for
            a new training complex at Lancing. In the meantime, Albion nearly
            fell into League 2, but they rallied to secure their status on the
            last day of the 2008/09 season, before securing promotion from
            League One in 2010/11 to secure Albion’s third title triumph at
            Withdean. And so the club moved into the new American Express
            Stadium (The Amex) as a Championship side, beating Doncaster Rovers
            2-1 in the first league fixture at the new venue on 6 August 2011.
            Will Buckley, the club’s first million-pound player, scored both
            goals. Initially built with a 22,500 capacity, the Amex was expanded
            to 30,750 seats in 2013. Following promotion to the Premier League
            in 2017, the stadium has had regular updates and now has a capacity
            of 31,876.

            After half a season of struggle under Sami Hyypia, Chris Hughton was
            appointed manager right at the end of 2014 and proceeded to
            stabilise the club. In 2015/16, Hughton’s side challenged at the
            right end of the Championship table once more, establishing a
            club-record 22-match unbeaten run in the league in the process. In a
            three-way battle with Burnley and Middlesbrough for the two
            automatic promotion places, Albion travelled to Middlesbrough on the
            last day of the season needing to win to go up, but could only draw.
            Perhaps drained by that effort, they then lost out to Sheffield
            Wednesday in the play-offs. But, just like 1978/79, Hughton and his
            team renewed their efforts in the 2016/17 season and, in tandem with
            Newcastle United, dominated the Championship campaign. Promotion to
            the Premier League was sealed on Easter Monday, 17 April, amid
            scenes of unbridled joy from the supporters, the players, the
            directors and the staff. The average number of tickets sold per
            match was 27,995, an unprecedented figure. Albion thus return to the
            top flight 34 years after they last played in it. Those three
            decades and more have seen the club plunge to unprecedented depths,
            but the determination of the club’s supporters – on the terraces, in
            the seats and in the boardroom – to see it survive and thrive has
            shone through. There are very few, if any, clubs in England where
            the bond between the supporters and their club – forged in the most
            adverse of circumstances – is as strong as at Brighton & Hove
            Albion. This was shown when over 100,000 supporters flocked to
            Brighton seafront for the club's open-top bus parade on Sunday 14th
            May, which marked a final celebration of the club's promotion to the
            Premier League. With a superb stadium (voted the best new stadium in
            the world in 2012), a world-class training facility, a
            multi-award-winning charitable arm (“Albion in the Community”), and
            exceptional club and team management, the future looks bright. No
            one knows what it will bring – but we know it won’t be for the want
            of trying.
